    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-me">
    <p>Hi, I'm Sarah, a Full Stack Web Developer based in London. </p>
    <p>A recent graduate from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, I've gone from working with people to working in programming.</p>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Leeds in 2014 with a BSc in Psychology, growing up surrounded by medics I thought this was what I wanted to do, but it always bothered me that nothing was definitive and you could only ever infer things. I'd always been interested in technology but only ever owned the products and thought the making of them was out of reach.</p>
    <p>So, I started working in recruitment and after a year working in Leeds moved down to London. I was constantly hearing about new developments in the tech industry and decided to teach myself to code, and after leaving recruitment and working as a Market Analyst for a leading start-up (and some very late nights self-teaching) I decided that this was something I really wanted to do, so decided to go all in and take the General Assembly course.</p>
    <p> I’m now looking forward to taking this further and joining a collaborative team where I can continue to learn and challenge myself.</p>

<h3>Commercial</h3>
</header>
<p>For the past 2.5 years I've worked in very commercial roles, so I'm excited to make the switch from being customer focussed to product and development foucssed, but I don't think that the two are mutually exclusive and am excited to bring potentially new ideas to problems.</p>

        <p>This was my first project on WDI, to understand the basic fundamentals of JavaScript. Klick it is a game where coloured squares appear at random and you gain points for clicking on correct squares, and lose points for clicking on incorrect squares.</p>

        <p>An authenticated app using the Google Maps, Google GPX Express, OpenSkiMaps and OpenWeatherMap API’s. The app allows users to look at different ski resorts, see the current weather and weather forecast and look up flight details. Written in jQuery, this was my first experience working with an external API.</p>

        <p>A team project, we built a RESTful app where users add events or activities, anything from a gig that they want to go to, to looking for someone to go rock climbing with, and other users are able to look through the events and request to join. Requests are sent to the event creator via the messaging system and they can choose to accept or reject requests.</p>

        <p>My final project on WDI using a Ruby of Rails backend and AngularJS front-end framework. Using the Spotify API and Web Sockets, users have visibility to music ‘rooms’ that they are authorised to enter, and the track playing syncs for all users in the room. Anyone can create a room and invite their friends to join.</p>
